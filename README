DESCRIPTION

This github project is a sample layout of a SUNWjet (JUMPSTART ENTERPRISE
TOOLKIT) infrastructure that can be seen as a starting idea on how you can
organize and manage your configuration.

Also some SUNWjass (Solaris Security Toolkit) Drivers and Finish scripts,
are maintained as part of this project, see inside Clients/common.files.

The resources in this project come mainly from my previous project of
setting and maintaining the end-to-end jumpstart solution for the Blastwave
Build Farm <http://www.blastwave.org/>.

This layout is structured the following way:

bin/jetme               # A script wrapper that automates the build process.
Clients/common.files    # Directory containing common configuration files,
                        # and SUNWjass Finish scripts and Drivers, all nicely
                        # grouped by the OS version.
Clients/common.files    # Directory containing common scripts to be executed
                        # as part of the jumpstart process, also grouped by
                        # the OS version.
Templates/Profiles      # Ready profiles to be used with the jetme script.


For more information on the particular components see subdirectories for
associated README files.

USAGE

You would probably want to clone this repository on the top of your SUNWjet
installation.

    # git clone git://github.com/mikenowak/jet-configs.git /opt/SUNWjet

NOTE

This project is not longer atcively maintained, and I might include
bug fixes, but any new functionality is highly unlikely to appear here.
